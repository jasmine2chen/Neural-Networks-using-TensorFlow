# Neural-Networks-using-TensorFlow

- Built and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classification of handwritten digits from MNIST
- Built and trained a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for music generation   
- Built and trained a facial detection model that learns the latent variables to adaptively re-sample the training data, thus mitigating any biases that may be present in order to train a debiased model
